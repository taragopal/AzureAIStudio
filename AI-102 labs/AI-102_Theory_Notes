-- Plan responsible GenAI solution by implementing: 
    -- Map: 
          Identify potential harms: offensive, pejorative, or discriminatory? factually wrong? illegal ? 
          Prioritize identified harms: likelyhood and the impact of the harm, then focus on the most harmful risks 
          Test and verify the prioritized harms: Use Red Teaming strategy 
          Document and share the verified harms

    -- Measure
    -- Mitigate:
        1. Model: Includes various genAI models and self trained and finetuned models 
        2. Safety System : content filters, platform level configs, four categories of potential harm (hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm).
        3. System message and grounding: Specify systems inputs, use RAGs, add prompt engineering to add grounding data
        4. User experience : 
    -- Manage: Use azure foundry contentent safely functionalities: 
Prompt shields >> 	Scans for the risk of user input attacks on language models
Groundedness detection	>> Detects if text responses are grounded in a user's source content
Protected material detection	>> Scans for known copyrighted content
Custom categories >>	Define custom categories for any new or emerging patterns
          
  Uses the NIST AI Risk management framework
